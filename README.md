## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn

* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
All resources were found on the Prework instruction site. 

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge that I overcame 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
 How to add different types of visual features into code? 
How to improve the efficiency of each function used in the JavaScript file?
How to gain access to more color options?
What challenges would I have if I wanted to convert this into a mobile application?
How could I use CSS to get the Java Script's button sounds?
How to enable light and dark mode?
What are the limits to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS?
How to add a splash screen?
How could the program handle data if I wanted to create the ability to log in and keep users' scores?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project, there are a few things I would want to add. When I initially started, I had the idea to make it Holloween themed hence why I called it "Mystery of Colors." I want to change the background into some gif that would correlate with the theme. The button shape was another area I wanted to change. I had the idea of changing those into question marks that could bounce in an up and down motion. The sounds of the buttons would be altered into classic Halloween sounds. When it came to the gameplay itself, I wanted a time and scoreboard of who could complete the game the fastest. If I had more time, I would have attempted to have different game modes. In particular, I had two in mind; the first would be a dual player mode, where players could set the pattern and have the other player play the sequence. The second mode would have been more challenging with more visual distractions and sounds. Lastly, when players win, I wanted to find a way to throw confetti similar to Canva when you submit assignments.
